# free-par-inject
Example Scala project combining the Inject typeclass from Data Types ala Carte with the Free Monad stacked on top of a Free Applicative. The result is the combination of different free algebras targeting different concerns and the ability to express both sequential and parallel evaluation strategies.

The project utilizes scalaz as the Scala FP programming library of choice.

This is currently a work in progress, but the idea is visible already.
